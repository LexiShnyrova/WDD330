        <li>client-side form validation,is an initial check and an important feature of good user experience; by
            catching invalid data on the client-side, the user can fix it straight away</li>
        <li>apps should always perform security checks on any form-submitted data on the server-side as well as the
            client-side,</li>

            <h4>What is form validation?</h4>
            "This field is required" (You can't leave this field blank).
            "Please enter your phone number in the format xxx-xxxx" (A specific data format is required for it to be considered
            valid).
            "Please enter a valid email address" (the data you entered is not in the right format).
            "Your password needs to be between 8 and 30 characters long and contain one uppercase letter, one symbol, and a number."
            (A very specific data format is required for your data).

            <h4>Different types of client-side validation</h4>
            Built-in form validation uses HTML5 form validation features, which we've discussed in many places throughout this
            module. This validation generally doesn't require much JavaScript. Built-in form validation has better performance than
            JavaScript, but it is not as customizable as JavaScript validation.
            JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is completely customizable, but you need to create it
            all (or use a library).
        </pre>
        </li>
        <li>Another useful validation feature is the pattern attribute, which expects a Regular Expression as its value.
            A regular
            expression (regex) is a pattern that can be used to match character combinations in text strings, so regexs
            are ideal
            for form validation and serve a variety of other uses in JavaScript.</li>
