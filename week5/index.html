    <h2>Note</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with
            which the program is interacting.
            Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it
            could even be as simple as a typo.
            User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is
            unable to handle.</li>
        <li>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the
            program to deal with the error.</li>
        <li>An exception will also produce a stack trace. This is a sequence of functions or
            method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred</li>
        <li>A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn’t enough to cause the
            program to crash.</li>
        <li>A strict mode that produces more exceptions and
            warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features.</li>
        <li>Linting tools such as JS Lint,1 JS Hint,2 and ES Lint3 can be used to test the
            quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode.
        <li>Programming in JavaScript can be something of a moving target as the APIs it
            uses are in a constant state of flux.</li>
        <li>Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then
            dealing with them.</li>
        <li>The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog
            at certain points in the code.</li>
        <li>Using console.log()</li>
        <li>Most modern browsers also have a debugging tool that allows you to set
            breakpoints in your code that will pause it at certain points.</li>
        <li>An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception
            occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor functio</li>
    </ul>
