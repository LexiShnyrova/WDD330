    <h3>Note</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an
            object that is provided as the first argument.</li>
        <li>If a function doesn’t refer to an object as this in its body, it can still be called
            using the call() method, but you need provide null as its first argument.</li>
        <li>An Immediately Invoked Function Expression – or IIFE (pronounced “iffy”) – is
            an anonymous function that, as the name suggests, is invoked as soon as it’s
            defined. This is easily achieved by placing parentheses at the end of the function
            definition.a useful way of performing a task while keeping any variables wrapped
            up within the scope of the function</li>
        <li>The dynamic nature of JavaScript means that a function is able to not only call
            itself, but define itself, and even redefine itself. This is done by assigning an
            anonymous function to a variable that has the same name as the function.</li>

    <h3>Code Example</h3>
    <li>
        <pre>
            // create sayHello function and use call() method
            function sayHello(){
            return `Hello, my name is ${ this.name }`;
            }

            const clark = { name: 'Clark' };
            const bruce = { name: 'Bruce' };
            sayHello.call(clark);
            << 'Hello, my name is Clarke' sayHello.call(bruce); << 'Hello, my name is Bruce'

            
            function sayHello(greeting='Hello'){
            return `${ greeting }, my name is ${ this.name }`;
            }
            sayHello.call(clark, 'How do you do');
            << 'How do you do, my name is Clark'
            sayHello.call(bruce);
            << 'Hello, my name is Bruce'

    <li>
        <pre>
            square.call(null, 4)
            << 16
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <pre>
            // The apply() method works in the same way, except the arguments of the
            // function are provided as an array, even if there is only one argument:
            square.apply(null, [4])
            << 16
        </pre>
    </li>
